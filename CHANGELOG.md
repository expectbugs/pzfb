# Changelog

## 1.7.2 (2026-05-03)

- **Fixed:** Cross-version gamepad support. PZFB 1.7.1 only worked on PZ 42.17+ (the Apr 22 patch); 1.7.0 only worked on PZ 42.16.3 and earlier. Players who hadn't yet updated PZ to 42.17 saw the "nil function" gamepad crash if they were on PZFB 1.7.1, and players who HAD updated saw the same crash if they stayed on PZFB 1.7.0. PZFB now feature-detects the gamepad API at Lua load time and dispatches each call (`isJoypadPressed` vs `JoypadButton.isButtonDown`, the ten removed `getJoypad*Button` globals vs `JoypadButton.fromIndex`) to whichever surface the running PZ has. A single PZFB build now works on both sides of the Apr 22 PZ patch.
- **Internal:** All PZFB-internal call sites that touched the version-specific APIs (`_seedControllerState`, `_pollSingleGamepad`, `_translateButton`) now go through two load-time shims — `_isButtonDown(cid, n)` and `_translateRawButton(rawIndex, controllerId)` — defined once at the top of `PZFBInput.lua`. Console prints `[PZFB] Gamepad API: ...` on startup so users can confirm which path is active.

## 1.7.1 (2026-05-02)

- **Fixed:** Gamepad seeding crash on B42 build `22869276` (Apr 22 2026 patch and later). PZ removed the global `isJoypadPressed(cid, n)` and ten `getJoypad*Button(cid)` globals (`getJoypadAButton`, `BButton`, `XButton`, `YButton`, `LBumper`, `RBumper`, `BackButton`, `StartButton`, `LeftStickButton`, `RightStickButton`). PZFBInput.lua now uses `JoypadButton.isButtonDown(cid, n)` for raw button polling and `JoypadButton.fromIndex(rawIndex)` for raw-index → button-identifier translation. Without this fix, dismissing an emulator's welcome screen with a controller plugged in throws `Object tried to call nil in _seedControllerState`; pressing any face button afterwards would have thrown `Object tried to call nil in _translateButton`.
- **Changed:** Version-mismatch detector in PZFBInit.lua now tolerates patch-level skew between mod.info and the deployed class files. A 1.7.0 class file satisfies any 1.7.x mod release, so Lua-only patch updates ship through Workshop without forcing every subscriber to re-run the install script. Minor (`1.7 → 1.8`) and major version differences still surface the "Update Required" prompt.
- **Compatibility:** This release requires PZ Build 42 patch `22869276` (Apr 22 2026) or newer. The new gamepad APIs do not exist on earlier B42 builds; PZFB 1.7.0 supports only earlier builds. There is no PZFB version that works on both sides of the patch — pick the one matching your PZ install.

## 1.7.0 (2026-04-22)

- **Added:** `PZFB.gameStartArgs(binaryPath, width, height, argv)` — array-based launch that bypasses the argument splitter. Use this for any path that may contain spaces, quotes, backslashes, or non-ASCII characters (Windows usernames like `Adam Marzello`, OneDrive-redirected Documents folders, apostrophes, Cyrillic/CJK/accented-Latin usernames). Each element of `argv` is passed verbatim to the child process — no escaping, no quoting, no parsing. Legacy `PZFB.gameStart(...)` continues to work unchanged.
- **Added:** `Color.fbGameStartArgv(String, int, int, String[])` Java method (distinct name, not an overload, to avoid any Kahlua dispatch ambiguity). Kahlua auto-marshals a Lua table with 1-based numeric keys into the `String[]` parameter.
- **Fixed:** Child game processes now terminate cleanly on JVM exit via a registered shutdown hook — prevents orphaned emulator/bridge processes from piling up across PZ sessions when a consumer mod forgets to call `PZFB.gameStop()` in some exit path, or when PZ exits via the normal Quit button without closing the emulator window. Limitation: the hook does **not** run on SIGKILL, power loss, or Windows Task Manager "End task" — a startup-time orphan scan is deferred to a future release.
- **Added:** Upgrade-detection prompt — when Steam Workshop ships new Lua + `.dat` files but the user hasn't re-run the install script, `PZFBInit.lua` compares `Color.fbPing()`'s reported version against `mod.info` and, on mismatch, shows a visible on-screen "Update Required" panel with the path to a freshly regenerated `pzfb_install.bat` / `pzfb_install.sh`. This ensures no one is silently stuck with Lua-new / bytecode-old state where new Java methods (`fbGameStartArgv`, the shutdown hook, etc.) aren't available to the running game.
- **Documented:** Explicit quoting rules for the legacy `gameStart`; multiplayer limitations of the Game Process API (per-player client-local, no frame sync); shutdown-hook behaviour and caveats.
- Internal: bumped Java-side `PZFB_VERSION` constant to `"1.7.0"` (previously stale at `"1.5.0"`) so `fbPing()` reports the correct installed version for the mismatch check above.

## 1.6.0 (2026-04-22)

- **Fixed:** Windows argument parsing — `fbGameStart` now supports quote-aware splitting so paths containing spaces (e.g. `C:\Users\Adam Marzello\...`) work when wrapped in double quotes. Stderr is captured to a temp file and the first five lines surface in `gameError()` when a process exits before producing any frames — no more opaque "exited immediately" reports.
- **Fixed:** `ProcessBuilder` working directory is now set to the binary's parent, so co-located DLLs resolve on Windows and config-file writes land next to the binary rather than in PZ's working directory.
- **Fixed:** Install-script generation — Windows path detection corrected (`ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid.jar` on Windows, no inner `projectzomboid/` subdirectory as on Linux).
- **Changed:** Workshop distribution now ships class files as `.dat` (inside `42/media/pzfb/`) and auto-generates a platform-specific install script at runtime (`~/Zomboid/Lua/pzfb_install.bat` or `.sh`) with the correct mod directory path embedded. Workshop blocks `.class`, `.bat`, and `.sh` from being uploaded directly.
- **Changed:** `PZFB.VERSION` is now read from `mod.info` via `getModInfoByID("PZFB"):getModVersion()` (authoritative — covers Lua-only updates where the Java class files weren't rebuilt). `Color.fbPing()` remains the deployment check; its version string became a fallback.

## 1.5.2 (2026-04-12)

- **Gamepad suppression** — PZ character no longer responds to captured gamepad input
  - Three-layer suppression: Lua `connected = false`, Java `setJoypadBind(-1)`, `JoypadState.controllerTest = true`
  - Per-frame enforcement in prerender prevents PZ's joypad re-activation from overriding suppression
  - All modes (EXCLUSIVE, SELECTIVE, FOCUS) correctly suppress; PASSIVE correctly does not
- **Key press consumption via `eatKeyPress`** — ALL captured keys now use `GameKeyboard.eatKeyPress(key)` to prevent any PZ release handling, including `Events.OnKeyPressed` and Java-level debug key handlers (e.g., F7 vehicle texture editor). Key releases detected via raw `Keyboard.isKeyDown` polling in prerender.
- **PlayStation controller position-based button remapping** — on PS controllers (DualSense, DualShock, etc.), A↔B and X↔Y are swapped in `_translateButton` so `onPZFBGamepadDown` delivers physical-position-correct button constants. Detection via PZ's `isPlaystationController()` plus name/GUID checks for DualSense.
- **Mouse no longer captured globally in toggle mode** — removed `setCapture(true)` from `_toggleCapture()`, allowing parent window UI (title bar, close button) to remain functional during exclusive capture
- **SELECTIVE mode gamepad enforcement** — per-frame controller suppression now includes SELECTIVE mode

## 1.5.1 (2026-04-12)

- **Gamepad auto-detection** — controllers are now automatically detected and assigned to input slots when `grabInput()` is called. Zero configuration required from mod authors.
  - Scans all 16 GLFW controller slots for connected devices
  - Seeds initial hardware state to prevent phantom button/axis events
  - Respects manually-assigned slots (`setSlotDevice`) and auto-assign slots (`setSlotAutoAssign`)
- **Hot-plug support** — controllers connected/disconnected mid-session are handled automatically via `Events.OnGamepadConnect` / `Events.OnGamepadDisconnect`
- **New public API: `getConnectedControllers()`** — returns `{id, name}` table for building controller selection UIs
- **Fix: `_slotForController` fallback** — no longer incorrectly returns keyboard slot (1) when no controller matches; returns nil
- **Fix: `saveInputConfig` no longer persists auto-detected slots** — only manually-assigned controller slots are saved

## 1.5.0 (2026-04-07)

- **`fbCopyFile(src, dst)`** — copy any file to any path, creating parent directories. Useful for deploying binaries from Workshop mods (which block `.exe` uploads — bundle as `.bin`/`.dat`, copy at runtime).
- **Game process API** — bidirectional process I/O for interactive applications (emulators, games)
  - `fbGameStart(binaryPath, width, height, extraArgs)` — launch a game binary with stdin/stdout I/O
  - `fbGameSendInput(keycode, pressed)` — send key events to the game via stdin
  - `fbGameIsRunning()` — check if game process is alive
  - `fbGameStatus()` — 0=idle, 1=starting, 2=running, 3=exited, 4=error
  - `fbGameError()` / `fbGameStop()` — error handling and cleanup
  - Reuses stream ring buffer — game stdout frames uploaded via `fbStreamFrame()`
  - **Wire protocol note:** `fbGameSendInput(keycode, pressed)` sends bytes in order `[pressed, keycode]` on the wire (pressed byte first, then keycode byte), despite the Lua parameter order being keycode first
- **Pressure-vessel fix** — `buildHostProcess` now passes absolute paths through unchanged (previously all paths were prefixed with `/run/host/usr/bin/`, breaking game binaries at absolute paths)
- **Stream/game mutual exclusion** — `fbStreamStart` now stops any running game process, and `fbGameStart` stops any running stream (shared ring buffer)
- Lua wrappers: `PZFB.gameStart()`, `gameSendInput()`, `gameIsRunning()`, `gameStatus()`, `gameError()`, `gameStop()`
- Class file count: 11 (was 10 in v1.3.0)

## 1.4.0 (2026-04-05)

- **Input system v2.0** — complete rewrite of `PZFBInput.lua`
  - Base class changed from ISPanel to ISPanelJoypad for full gamepad support
  - Four capture modes: EXCLUSIVE, SELECTIVE, PASSIVE, FOCUS
  - **Capture toggle key** — user-definable key to lock/unlock input to framebuffer panel
  - **Keyboard**: `onPZFBKeyDown`, `onPZFBKeyRepeat` (held keys), `onPZFBKeyUp` callbacks + polling
  - **Mouse**: click, release, move, wheel callbacks with panel-relative coordinates
  - **Gamepad**: button press/release, analog stick axes, trigger callbacks + polling
  - **Multi-controller input slots** — keyboard+mouse as slot 1, controllers as slot 2+
  - **Auto-assign** — controller auto-detection on button press
  - **Action mapping** — named actions with multiple bindings (keyboard + gamepad + analog axes)
  - **Selective capture** — consume keys by keycode or game binding name (follows user rebinds)
  - **Automatic cleanup** — input released on close, hide, remove, player death, or menu return
  - **Config persistence** — save/load action mappings and settings to `~/Zomboid/Lua/`
  - Modifier key polling (`isModifierDown("shift"/"ctrl"/"alt")`)
  - Configurable escape handling (close panel, release capture, or treat as regular key)

## 1.3.0 (2026-04-03)

- **Streaming video playback** — zero disk usage for video
  - `fbStreamStart(path, qualityScale, bufferFrames)` — quality as fraction of source resolution (0.0-1.0)

  - Auto-detects source dimensions, FPS, duration via ffprobe
  - Configurable buffer size (default 120 frames)
  - Writer thread throttles to playback speed (waits when buffer full)
  - Separate stderr handling — binary stdout stays clean for raw RGBA data
- **Streaming audio** — near-instant start (~2 sec), no OGG encoding
  - ffmpeg decodes audio to raw PCM, Java writes WAV with streaming header

  - Reads host's /etc/ld.so.conf + includes for complete library path discovery
  - Clears JVM's LD_PRELOAD for child processes
  - Separate stderr handling for binary vs text process output
- `fbFFmpegDiag()` / `fbAudioSeekDiag()` — troubleshooting helpers
- Lua API wrappers for all stream methods
