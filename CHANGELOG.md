# Changelog

## 1.7.1 (2026-05-02)

- **Fixed:** Gamepad seeding crash on B42 build `22869276` (Apr 22 2026 patch and later). PZ removed the global `isJoypadPressed(cid, n)` and ten `getJoypad*Button(cid)` globals (`getJoypadAButton`, `BButton`, `XButton`, `YButton`, `LBumper`, `RBumper`, `BackButton`, `StartButton`, `LeftStickButton`, `RightStickButton`). PZFBInput.lua now uses `JoypadButton.isButtonDown(cid, n)` for raw button polling and `JoypadButton.fromIndex(rawIndex)` for raw-index → button-identifier translation. Without this fix, dismissing an emulator's welcome screen with a controller plugged in throws `Object tried to call nil in _seedControllerState`; pressing any face button afterwards would have thrown `Object tried to call nil in _translateButton`.
- **Changed:** Version-mismatch detector in PZFBInit.lua now tolerates patch-level skew between mod.info and the deployed class files. A 1.7.0 class file satisfies any 1.7.x mod release, so Lua-only patch updates ship through Workshop without forcing every subscriber to re-run the install script. Minor (`1.7 → 1.8`) and major version differences still surface the "Update Required" prompt.
- **Compatibility:** This release requires PZ Build 42 patch `22869276` (Apr 22 2026) or newer. The new gamepad APIs do not exist on earlier B42 builds; PZFB 1.7.0 supports only earlier builds. There is no PZFB version that works on both sides of the patch — pick the one matching your PZ install.

## 1.7.0 (2026-04-22)

- **Added:** `PZFB.gameStartArgs(binaryPath, width, height, argv)` — array-based launch that bypasses the argument splitter. Use this for any path that may contain spaces, quotes, backslashes, or non-ASCII characters (Windows usernames like `Adam Marzello`, OneDrive-redirected Documents folders, apostrophes, Cyrillic/CJK/accented-Latin usernames). Each element of `argv` is passed verbatim to the child process — no escaping, no quoting, no parsing. Legacy `PZFB.gameStart(...)` continues to work unchanged.
- **Added:** `Color.fbGameStartArgv(String, int, int, String[])` Java method (distinct name, not an overload, to avoid any Kahlua dispatch ambiguity). Kahlua auto-marshals a Lua table with 1-based numeric keys into the `String[]` parameter.
- **Fixed:** Child game processes now terminate cleanly on JVM exit via a registered shutdown hook — prevents orphaned emulator/bridge processes from piling up across PZ sessions when a consumer mod forgets to call `PZFB.gameStop()` in some exit path, or when PZ exits via the normal Quit button without closing the emulator window. Limitation: the hook does **not** run on SIGKILL, power loss, or Windows Task Manager "End task" — a startup-time orphan scan is deferred to a future release.
- **Added:** Upgrade-detection prompt — when Steam Workshop ships new Lua + `.dat` files but the user hasn't re-run the install script, `PZFBInit.lua` compares `Color.fbPing()`'s reported version against `mod.info` and, on mismatch, shows a visible on-screen "Update Required" panel with the path to a freshly regenerated `pzfb_install.bat` / `pzfb_install.sh`. This ensures no one is silently stuck with Lua-new / bytecode-old state where new Java methods (`fbGameStartArgv`, the shutdown hook, etc.) aren't available to the running game.
- **Documented:** Explicit quoting rules for the legacy `gameStart`; multiplayer limitations of the Game Process API (per-player client-local, no frame sync); shutdown-hook behaviour and caveats.
- Internal: bumped Java-side `PZFB_VERSION` constant to `"1.7.0"` (previously stale at `"1.5.0"`) so `fbPing()` reports the correct installed version for the mismatch check above.

## 1.6.0 (2026-04-22)

- **Fixed:** Windows argument parsing — `fbGameStart` now supports quote-aware splitting so paths containing spaces (e.g. `C:\Users\Adam Marzello\...`) work when wrapped in double quotes. Stderr is captured to a temp file and the first five lines surface in `gameError()` when a process exits before producing any frames — no more opaque "exited immediately" reports.
- **Fixed:** `ProcessBuilder` working directory is now set to the binary's parent, so co-located DLLs resolve on Windows and config-file writes land next to the binary rather than in PZ's working directory.
- **Fixed:** Install-script generation — Windows path detection corrected (`ProjectZomboid/projectzomboid.jar` on Windows, no inner `projectzomboid/` subdirectory as on Linux).
- **Changed:** Workshop distribution now ships class files as `.dat` (inside `42/media/pzfb/`) and auto-generates a platform-specific install script at runtime (`~/Zomboid/Lua/pzfb_install.bat` or `.sh`) with the correct mod directory path embedded. Workshop blocks `.class`, `.bat`, and `.sh` from being uploaded directly.
- **Changed:** `PZFB.VERSION` is now read from `mod.info` via `getModInfoByID("PZFB"):getModVersion()` (authoritative — covers Lua-only updates where the Java class files weren't rebuilt). `Color.fbPing()` remains the deployment check; its version string became a fallback.

## 1.5.2 (2026-04-12)

- **Gamepad suppression** — PZ character no longer responds to captured gamepad input
  - Three-layer suppression: Lua `connected = false`, Java `setJoypadBind(-1)`, `JoypadState.controllerTest = true`
  - Per-frame enforcement in prerender prevents PZ's joypad re-activation from overriding suppression
  - All modes (EXCLUSIVE, SELECTIVE, FOCUS) correctly suppress; PASSIVE correctly does not
- **Key press consumption via `eatKeyPress`** — ALL captured keys now use `GameKeyboard.eatKeyPress(key)` to prevent any PZ release handling, including `Events.OnKeyPressed` and Java-level debug key handlers (e.g., F7 vehicle texture editor). Key releases detected via raw `Keyboard.isKeyDown` polling in prerender.
- **PlayStation controller position-based button remapping** — on PS controllers (DualSense, DualShock, etc.), A↔B and X↔Y are swapped in `_translateButton` so `onPZFBGamepadDown` delivers physical-position-correct button constants. Detection via PZ's `isPlaystationController()` plus name/GUID checks for DualSense.
- **Mouse no longer captured globally in toggle mode** — removed `setCapture(true)` from `_toggleCapture()`, allowing parent window UI (title bar, close button) to remain functional during exclusive capture
- **SELECTIVE mode gamepad enforcement** — per-frame controller suppression now includes SELECTIVE mode

## 1.5.1 (2026-04-12)

- **Gamepad auto-detection** — controllers are now automatically detected and assigned to input slots when `grabInput()` is called. Zero configuration required from mod authors.
  - Scans all 16 GLFW controller slots for connected devices
  - Seeds initial hardware state to prevent phantom button/axis events
  - Respects manually-assigned slots (`setSlotDevice`) and auto-assign slots (`setSlotAutoAssign`)
- **Hot-plug support** — controllers connected/disconnected mid-session are handled automatically via `Events.OnGamepadConnect` / `Events.OnGamepadDisconnect`
- **New public API: `getConnectedControllers()`** — returns `{id, name}` table for building controller selection UIs
- **Fix: `_slotForController` fallback** — no longer incorrectly returns keyboard slot (1) when no controller matches; returns nil
- **Fix: `saveInputConfig` no longer persists auto-detected slots** — only manually-assigned controller slots are saved

## 1.5.0 (2026-04-07)

- **`fbCopyFile(src, dst)`** — copy any file to any path, creating parent directories. Useful for deploying binaries from Workshop mods (which block `.exe` uploads — bundle as `.bin`/`.dat`, copy at runtime).
- **Game process API** — bidirectional process I/O for interactive applications (emulators, games)
  - `fbGameStart(binaryPath, width, height, extraArgs)` — launch a game binary with stdin/stdout I/O
  - `fbGameSendInput(keycode, pressed)` — send key events to the game via stdin
  - `fbGameIsRunning()` — check if game process is alive
  - `fbGameStatus()` — 0=idle, 1=starting, 2=running, 3=exited, 4=error
  - `fbGameError()` / `fbGameStop()` — error handling and cleanup
  - Reuses stream ring buffer — game stdout frames uploaded via `fbStreamFrame()`
  - **Wire protocol note:** `fbGameSendInput(keycode, pressed)` sends bytes in order `[pressed, keycode]` on the wire (pressed byte first, then keycode byte), despite the Lua parameter order being keycode first
- **Pressure-vessel fix** — `buildHostProcess` now passes absolute paths through unchanged (previously all paths were prefixed with `/run/host/usr/bin/`, breaking game binaries at absolute paths)
- **Stream/game mutual exclusion** — `fbStreamStart` now stops any running game process, and `fbGameStart` stops any running stream (shared ring buffer)
- Lua wrappers: `PZFB.gameStart()`, `gameSendInput()`, `gameIsRunning()`, `gameStatus()`, `gameError()`, `gameStop()`
- Class file count: 11 (was 10 in v1.3.0)

## 1.4.0 (2026-04-05)

- **Input system v2.0** — complete rewrite of `PZFBInput.lua`
  - Base class changed from ISPanel to ISPanelJoypad for full gamepad support
  - Four capture modes: EXCLUSIVE, SELECTIVE, PASSIVE, FOCUS
  - **Capture toggle key** — user-definable key to lock/unlock input to framebuffer panel
  - **Keyboard**: `onPZFBKeyDown`, `onPZFBKeyRepeat` (held keys), `onPZFBKeyUp` callbacks + polling
  - **Mouse**: click, release, move, wheel callbacks with panel-relative coordinates
  - **Gamepad**: button press/release, analog stick axes, trigger callbacks + polling
  - **Multi-controller input slots** — keyboard+mouse as slot 1, controllers as slot 2+
  - **Auto-assign** — controller auto-detection on button press
  - **Action mapping** — named actions with multiple bindings (keyboard + gamepad + analog axes)
  - **Selective capture** — consume keys by keycode or game binding name (follows user rebinds)
  - **Automatic cleanup** — input released on close, hide, remove, player death, or menu return
  - **Config persistence** — save/load action mappings and settings to `~/Zomboid/Lua/`
  - Modifier key polling (`isModifierDown("shift"/"ctrl"/"alt")`)
  - Configurable escape handling (close panel, release capture, or treat as regular key)

## 1.3.0 (2026-04-03)

- **Streaming video playback** — zero disk usage for video
  - `fbStreamStart(path, qualityScale, bufferFrames)` — quality as fraction of source resolution (0.0-1.0)

  - Auto-detects source dimensions, FPS, duration via ffprobe
  - Configurable buffer size (default 120 frames)
  - Writer thread throttles to playback speed (waits when buffer full)
  - Separate stderr handling — binary stdout stays clean for raw RGBA data
- **Streaming audio** — near-instant start (~2 sec), no OGG encoding
